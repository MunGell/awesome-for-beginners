# Awesome First Pull Request Opportunities

Inspired by the *First Timers Only* blog post.

If you are a maintainer of open-source projects, add the label `first-timers-only` (or similar) to your project and list it here so that people can find it.

If you are not a programmer but would like to contribute, check out the [Awesome for non-programmers](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-non-programmers) list.

If you would like guidance on contributing to a repository on GitHub, check out the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository.

# Contribution Guide & Guidelines 🚀

Welcome to the **Awesome First Pull Request Opportunities** project! We're excited that you want to contribute.

This guide aims to help you get started contributing new repositories to the list.

It outlines the recommended order for executing tasks and assumes that you have identified a repository you wish to add to the list. Check out the repository requirements section, if you would like to know what a good addition should have.

_Please note that the list in this repository is intended for more substantial projects, and we kindly ask that small personal projects not be added in the hope of receiving contributions. Thank you for your understanding._

## Intitial Checks

- **Search for Duplicates**: Check the current list and previous pull requests to avoid submitting duplicates.

## Repository Requirements

- **Reasonably Developed**: The repository must be reasonably established, along with having with a clear goal or function. New repositories with few commits and little content will likely be rejected.
- **Active Maintenance**: Ensure the contributed repository is actively maintained.
- **Appropriate Labels**: Issues with appropriate beginner-friend labels must exist. Confirm with the owner around a label's meaning if it's not obviously beginner-friendly (usually `good-first-issue` or `low-hanging-fruit`).
- **Supportive Community**: The repository should have a supportive community.

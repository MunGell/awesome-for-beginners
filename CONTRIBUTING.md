# Contribution Guide & Guidelines ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Awesome First Pull Request Opportunities** project! We're excited that you want to contribute.

This guide aims to help you get started contributing new repositories to the list.

It outlines the recommended order for executing tasks and assumes that you have identified a repository you wish to add to the list. Check out the repository requirements section if you would like to know what a good addition should have.

_Please note that the list in this repository is intended for more substantial projects, and we kindly ask that small personal projects not be added in the hope of receiving contributions. Thank you for your understanding._

---

## Initial Checks

- **Search for Duplicates**: Check the current list and previous pull requests to avoid submitting duplicates.

---

## Repository Requirements

- **Reasonably Developed**: The repository must be reasonably established, with a clear goal or function. New repositories with few commits and little content will likely be rejected.
- **Active Maintenance**: Ensure the contributed repository is actively maintained.
- **Appropriate Labels**: Issues with appropriate beginner-friendly labels must exist. Confirm with the owner if a label's meaning is not obvious (usually `good-first-issue` or `low-hanging-fruit`).
- **Supportive Community**: The repository should have a supportive community.

## Making Changes and Opening a PR (Pull Request)

### 1. **Edit the `data.json` File Directly on GitHub**

The easiest way to contribute is by editing the `data.json` file directly in your browser. Here's how:

1. Go to the [`data.json` file](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/blob/main/data.json) in the repository.
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon) in the top right corner.
3. Make your changes directly in the browser:
   - Copy an existing entry in the file.
   - Fill in your own information following the same format.
   - Ensure the following:
     - **Direct Links**: Links must point directly to the repository. No tracking links or ads.
     - **Spelling and Grammar**: Proofread your contribution.
     - **Trailing Whitespace**: Avoid adding trailing whitespace (at the end of lines).
     - **Single Addition**: Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
     - **New Technologies**: New technologies are welcome â€” just add them and a new heading will be generated.
4. Describe your changes concisely in the commit message.
5. Click **"Propose changes"** to create a new branch and open a Pull Request (PR).

### 2. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**

1. After proposing changes, GitHub will guide you through creating a PR.
2. Fill out the PR form, ensuring its content (especially the title) is understandable, descriptive, and relevant.
3. If your suggested repository uses a non-obvious beginner-friendly issue label, provide confirmation or proof that the label is beginner friendly.
4. Submit the PR and wait for feedback from the maintainers.

### 3. **Reporting an Issue**

If you encounter an issue or have a suggestion that you don't want to implement yourself, open an issue and provide:

- A clear description of the problem or suggestion.
- The expected behavior (if creating a feature request or bug report).
- The current behavior (if creating a bug report).
